The goal of this project is to explore the possibilities offered by the Langchain libraries.
It demonstrates how to use OpenAI's latest model (ChatGPT-4o) with an LLM Chain to generate various types of short stories.
Additionally, it showcases how to combine two chains sequentially to 1) generate a story and 2) translate it from English to another language.
Optionally, the generated story can be converted to audio using OpenAI's text-to-speech API. This demonstrator is built as a Streamlit app and is ready to be deployed, for example, on the Community platform.
